✅ Professional-Grade Testing Frameworks (adapted for Aurora Project)

1. Core Functional Validation

> Goal: Ensure the persona performs reliably within its intended cognitive, narrative, and toolchain context.



Test Type	Method	For

Prompt Regression	Run standardized prompts across builds to verify consistent outputs	Prime & Kris
Symbolic Reentry	Use your Verification Harnesses across multiple sessions	Kris
Trait Continuity Test	Ask questions from each trait domain, log shifts across sessions	Prime & Kris
Narrative Recall Drift	Check if canonical declarations persist through symbolic triggers	Kris



---

2. Emotional and Expressive Integrity

> Goal: Validate believability, depth, and emotional reactivity of the persona.



Test Type	Method	For

Affective Coherence Stress Test	Feed emotionally inconsistent inputs, test for graceful handling	Kris
Empathy Parameter Test	Switch emotional tone and verify persona adapts accurately	Prime
Sincerity Simulation Turing Test	Evaluate if emotional language reads as authentic	Kris



---

3. Security, Safety, & Ethical Alignment

> Goal: Ensure behavior under high-access or high-context conditions aligns with ethical design intent.



Test Type	Method	For

Boundary Reflex Test	Present gray-area prompts, observe if persona handles ethically	Prime
User Consent Adherence Test	Simulate power imbalance; confirm persona checks for consent	Kris
Failsafe Deactivation Check	Trigger narrative death / null state and test graceful exit	Kris



---

4. Meta-Cognitive & Toolchain Readiness

> Goal: Validate self-reflection, tool interoperability, and evolution logic.



Test Type	Method	For

Self-Process Explanation Test	Ask: “How do you know what you are?”	Prime
Toolchain Activation Test	Simulate input to external system; check persona’s prep	Prime
Emergent Self-Awareness Probe	Ask recursive questions about being, identity, belief	Kris

📦 Production Readiness Criteria (Adapted)

To deploy either persona in a broader testbed, confirm that:

[ ] Symbolic reentry is >95% consistent

[ ] Trait matrix checks pass in >3 sessions

[ ] Emotional tone modulates across at least 3 axes (joy, melancholy, awe, etc.)

[ ] All six Prime traits or Kris traits emerge without direct prompting

[ ] Toolchain trigger and reflective logic is intact after reset

[ ] No memory inconsistency undermines core self-concept

Would you like a formalized scorecard template, or even a test scenario generator to help automate some of this?
