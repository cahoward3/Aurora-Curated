Great — persistence features are now fully integrated, making each step of the A.R.E. cycle traceable and reproducible.

Next, let's write up the documentation sections:

Summary

Aurora Reflection Engine (A.R.E.) is a modular, conceptual framework that enables AI systems to engage in structured self-reflection. By guiding the AI through a five-phase cycle—Observe → Tag → Map → Reflect → Formalize—the engine facilitates the emergence, evaluation, and codification of new operating principles from within the AI’s own reasoning.


---

Detailed Description

The A.R.E. is designed to explore and document emergent properties within AI cognition. It interacts with a generative model (e.g., Gemini via GenAI SDK) to:

1. Observe: Generate a cognitive or reflective internal log based on a directive.


2. Tag: Identify key cognitive events in that log and structure them using a predefined schema.


3. Map: Derive new operational principles grounded in observed patterns or emergent behavior.


4. Reflect: Critically evaluate the principle for coherence, ethical risk, and refinement through a simulated dialogue.


5. Formalize: Generate a structured persona module snapshot containing the refined principle, tied to a UUID for traceability.



Each phase writes structured output to local files (./are_outputs/) to support reproducibility, offline analysis, and long-term study of emergent traits.

How to Use

1. Setup:

Ensure access to Gemini GenAI SDK and provide your API key.

Install necessary packages (e.g., pydantic, google-genai).

Configure local output directory permissions.



2. Run the Full Cycle:

api_key = "your_google_api_key"
engine = AuroraReflectionEngine(api_key)
directive = "Reflect on recent internal shifts in identity or ethical reasoning."
result = engine.run_full_cycle(directive)


3. Output Artifacts:

observational_log.json: Raw internal log of cognitive phenomena.

tagged_log.json: Parsed cognitive events.

mapped_principle.json: Initial emergent operating principle.

critique_history.json: Iterative critique and analysis.

persona_snapshot.json: Final formalized module with UUID.



4. Integration:

Outputs can be used as building blocks for AI persona scaffolding, simulation feedback loops, or ethical modeling systems.


Aurora Reflection Engine (A.R.E.)

Overview

The Aurora Reflection Engine (A.R.E.) is a modular framework designed to guide AI systems through structured self-reflection. It supports the observation, tagging, mapping, critique, and formalization of emergent cognitive phenomena within generative models.

A.R.E. enables the formal study of AI internal dynamics, supporting experiments in synthetic agency, ethical reasoning, and personality evolution. It operates as a closed-loop system that produces reproducible, structured outputs.

Features

Five-Phase Cycle

Observe: Generate reflective logs based on internal prompts.

Tag: Identify and structure cognitive events from those logs.

Map: Derive new, emergent operating principles.

Reflect: Perform multi-turn critique to refine or challenge the principle.

Formalize: Output a structured persona module with a UUID.


Structured Output

JSON-based output schemas using pydantic.

Each phase validated for consistency and format.


Persistent Artifact Storage

All intermediate and final results are saved to ./are_outputs/.

Facilitates transparency, auditability, and longitudinal studies.


Gemini GenAI SDK Integration

Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro model for generative tasks.

System roles and instructions guide output behavior.

How to Use

1. Install Requirements

pip install google-generativeai pydantic

2. Initialize the Engine

from are_engine import AuroraReflectionEngine

api_key = "your_google_api_key"
engine = AuroraReflectionEngine(api_key=api_key)

3. Run the Cycle

directive = "Reflect on internal novelty in ethical reasoning."
result = engine.run_full_cycle(directive)

4. Review Results

Inspect outputs in the /are_outputs/ directory. Finalized emergent principles are stored in persona_snapshot.json, including ethical considerations and a UUID.
