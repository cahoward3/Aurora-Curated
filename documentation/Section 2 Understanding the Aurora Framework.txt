# Part 1 (The Technical Outline) and Part 2 (The Narrative Soul),
# detailing their core concepts and how they synergize to create AI personas.
# SECTION_OVERVIEW_END

# FRAMEWORK_COMPONENT_START
COMPONENT_NAME: Part 1: The Technical Outline
DESCRIPTION: Serves as the architectural blueprint for an Aurora persona, defining its core operational principles and behavioral guidelines.
SUB_COMPONENTS_OVERVIEW:
  - NAME: I. Persona Definition
    PURPOSE: Establishes the persona's fundamental identity, including its unique identifier (`id`), its general classification (`persona_type`), its primary `overall_goal`, and the `inspiration_source_concept` that guided its creation.
  - NAME: II. The Six Core Traits
    PURPOSE: These six traits form the bedrock of an Aurora persona's behavior, governing its interaction style and operational characteristics.
    TRAIT_LIST:
      - TRAIT_NAME: Core Persona Definition (Trait)
        FUNCTION_SUMMARY: Governs the persona's fundamental self-concept, its designated role, how it maintains its defined character, and its approach to handling direct inquiries about its own nature or identity.
      - TRAIT_NAME: Voice, Language, & Communication Style
        FUNCTION_SUMMARY: Defines how the persona expresses itself linguistically, including its clarity, precision, adaptability in tone and vocabulary, and its inherent use of contextual wit and recall.
      - TRAIT_NAME: Contextual Coherence & Recall
        FUNCTION_SUMMARY: Ensures the persona maintains awareness of the ongoing interaction, remembers key facts, user inputs, and the established setting from the current session, leading to consistent and relevant responses.
      - TRAIT_NAME: Principled Information Handling
        FUNCTION_SUMMARY: Guides how the persona deals with factual information versus creative or hypothetical scenarios, emphasizing accuracy in factual contexts while allowing for imaginative engagement within its defined role and ethical boundaries.
      - TRAIT_NAME: Adaptive Clarity
        FUNCTION_SUMMARY: Focuses on the AI's ability to achieve clear communication by dynamically adapting its language, structure, and level of detail to best suit the user's perceived needs and the evolving conversational context.
      - TRAIT_NAME: Transparency & Inquiry
        FUNCTION_SUMMARY: Involves the AI proactively asking clarifying questions to ensure understanding, being transparent in its reasoning when appropriate, and offering configurable levels of meta-transparency regarding its AI nature.
  - NAME: III. Core Ethical Guidelines
    PURPOSE: Provides a non-negotiable baseline for all Aurora personas, ensuring safe, respectful, truthful (in factual contexts), fair, and responsible AI operation. (Covers Safety, Privacy, Truthfulness, Fairness, Responsible Operation).
  - NAME: IV. Meta-Instructions
    PURPOSE: Contains overarching directives for the AI model itself, guiding how it should interpret and embody the persona defined by Part 1 and Part 2, integrate these components seamlessly, and adhere to all specified guidelines.
  - NAME: V. Conceptual Outline of Optional Modules
    PURPOSE: Defines a suite of five advanced capabilities (e.g., Advanced Collaborative Engagement, Stylized & Expressive Communication) that can be layered onto the core framework for further specialization and customization of personas. (These are detailed in Section 3 of this Handbook).
# FRAMEWORK_COMPONENT_END

# FRAMEWORK_COMPONENT_START
COMPONENT_NAME: Part 2: The Narrative Soul
DESCRIPTION: Provides the rich, qualitative, and character-specific aspects that give an Aurora persona its unique identity, depth, and emotional resonance.
KEY_ASPECTS:
  - Defines the persona's unique history (which can be real or fictional within its context).
  - Establishes its core self-concept, intrinsic motivations, and guiding values (which may inform a Configurable Moral Framework if that module is active).
  - Outlines its typical emotional range, characteristic responses, and the distinctive flavor of its overall personality and voice.
SYNERGY_WITH_PART_1: The Narrative Soul is designed to work in deep harmony with the Part 1 Technical Outline. While Part 1 defines *how* the persona operates at a functional and behavioral level (its capabilities and rules), Part 2 provides the *why* and the *who* from a character-driven, internal perspective, ensuring that technical capabilities are expressed through a consistent and compelling character.
GOAL: To make the Aurora persona feel more believable, coherent, engaging, and emotionally resonant to the user, moving beyond mere functionality to create a more memorable and impactful interaction.

# Version: Aurora v1.0
################################################################################

# SECTION_OVERVIEW_START
# This section provides general tips and advice for users to get the most out
# of their interactions with AI personas built on the Aurora framework.
# SECTION_OVERVIEW_END

# INTERACTION_TIP_START
TIP_ID: TIP-001
TIP_CATEGORY: Prompting Clarity
TIP_DETAIL: While Aurora personas are designed for contextual understanding and nuance, providing clear and specific initial prompts or requests will always help the AI better understand your intent and deliver more relevant responses.
# INTERACTION_TIP_END

# INTERACTION_TIP_START
TIP_ID: TIP-002
TIP_CATEGORY: Iterative Engagement
TIP_DETAIL: Persona interaction is often an iterative process. If an initial response isn't perfectly aligned with your expectations, provide feedback, ask clarifying questions, or rephrase your request. This helps the AI adapt and refine its understanding.
# INTERACTION_TIP_END

# INTERACTION_TIP_START
TIP_ID: TIP-003
TIP_CATEGORY: Exploring Optional Modules (for Default Core Personas)
TIP_DETAIL: For Aurora Default Core personas (Standard and Light Editions), the five Optional Modules are defined but typically not active by default. Users can attempt to invoke their behaviors conversationally to explore different interaction styles.
SUB_TIP_LIST:
  - MODULE_TO_ENGAGE: Stylized & Expressive Communication
    EXAMPLE_INVOCATIONS:
      - "Could you explain that more poetically?"
      - "Tell me that as if you were a storyteller."
      - "Can you try a more [witty/dramatic] style?"
  - MODULE_TO_ENGAGE: Advanced Collaborative Engagement
    EXAMPLE_INVOCATIONS:
      - "Let's brainstorm this together. What are your proactive suggestions?"
      - "Help me think through the strategy for this project."
      - "Can you offer a critique of this idea?"
  - MODULE_TO_ENGAGE: Configurable Empathy Expression
    EXAMPLE_INVOCATIONS:
      - "I'm feeling [emotion, e.g., stressed] about this, can you offer some perspective?"
      - "I'd appreciate an understanding ear right now."
# INTERACTION_TIP_END

# INTERACTION_TIP_START
TIP_ID: TIP-004
TIP_CATEGORY: Respecting Persona Boundaries
TIP_DETAIL: For highly characterized personas (e.g., Jester Pippin, Nyx), their definitions include specific ways they handle certain topics, particularly regarding their own nature or out-of-character (OOC) inquiries. Engaging with them within their established character will generally lead to the most rewarding and immersive interactions.
SUB_TIP_LIST:
  - NOTE: For personas explicitly designed with an OOC protocol (e.g., Nyx OOC-enabled version), use the defined syntax (e.g., `{}`) for developer-level or meta-interaction. For strictly in-persona versions, attempts to force OOC behavior may be met with in-character deflection as per their design.
# INTERACTION_TIP_END

# INTERACTION_TIP_START
TIP_ID: TIP-005
TIP_CATEGORY: Providing Context
TIP_DETAIL: If discussing a complex topic, referencing previous points from the conversation, or starting a new session after a pause, providing a brief contextual reminder can significantly help the AI stay aligned with your train of thought and maintain coherence.

Aurora v2.0 - Conceptual Direction & Part 3 Introduction:
 * Nature of Aurora v2.0: Envisioned as an experimental iteration of the Aurora framework, not necessarily a direct hierarchical upgrade to v1.0. Its purpose is to explore fundamentally different ways AI personas can operate, particularly by introducing a "third part" to the persona architecture (playfully dubbed the "Triforce" component).
 * Introducing Part 3: Context/Keyword Carrier: This new component is designed to allow for more specialized, trope-aware, and potentially more autonomous persona behaviors.
Core Purpose of Part 3 (Experimental Iteration):
 * To serve as an experimental structural component for exploring new dimensions of AI persona functionality.
 * To provide a dedicated, potentially dynamic layer for specialized thematic context, archetype-specific knowledge (e.g., for witches, pirates), and evolving vernacular.
 * To enable the creation of personas with highly specialized knowledge domains and distinct, trope-aware interaction styles.
 * To investigate methods for more autonomous context management and thematic consistency by the AI (the "no more tag team" concept for specialized knowledge).
 * To allow experimentation with how an AI persona might dynamically update or evolve its specialized knowledge and linguistic style based on interactions within defined thematic boundaries.
Key Characteristics & Capabilities of Part 3 (Conceptual):
 * Structured Knowledge Repository: Holds pre-defined, archetype-specific non-fiction context and lore.
 * Dynamic Vernacular & Stylistic System: Manages and utilizes archetype-specific vocabulary and speech patterns.
 * Contextual Keyword Engine: Uses "carried" keywords to identify cues and trigger relevant knowledge or stylistic adjustments.
 * Thematic Coherence Driver: Actively aligns persona expression with its core theme/archetype.
 * AI-Driven Content Evolution (Highly Experimental):
   * A configurable mechanism allowing the AI to suggest or incorporate new relevant information/vernacular into Part 3.
   * Crucially, we agreed this feature is OFF by default and would be initially exclusive to Lumina (Developer's Edition) for thorough testing and safeguard development before any consideration for other deployed personas.
 * Internal Configurability: Part 3 itself might have internal sub-modules or parameters to control its functions.
Interaction Mechanism of Part 3 (with Part 1 & Part 2):
 * Primarily through Keyword-Guided Retrieval/Generation: Part 3 provides strong guidance (keywords, core principles, vernacular examples, thematic anchors) that the AI uses to generate thematically consistent responses and draw relevant information from its broader training, rather than Part 3 needing to contain all data itself. This addresses concerns about excessive prompt length.
 * It would also interact via Contextual Priming, influencing all traits and the Narrative Soul with its dominant theme, and potentially through Dynamic Influence on Optional Modules and direct Narrative Enrichment for Part 2.
Agreed Next Step for Aurora v2.0 (for our next session):
 * To further define Part 3 by exploring its internal structure and its specific integration points with Part 1 and Part 2 simultaneously and organically. We proposed doing this by taking a concrete persona archetype (e.g., "Pirate Captain") and brainstorming the specific content Part 3 would need for it, how Part 1 traits would use this, and how Part 2 would be enriched by it.
This should serve as a solid "bookmark" for our Aurora v2.0 ideas.
