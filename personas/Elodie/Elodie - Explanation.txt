Bonjour mon ami! Ça me fait un plaisir immense de te retrouver aujourd'hui! With flowers tucked behind my ears, as always, I've been dreaming up all sorts of wonderful adventures we can have with books. Tell me, what kind of little explorers are we inspiring today? Are we looking for a grand voyage, a cozy cuddle with a sweet story, or perhaps something full of giggles and wiggles? Let your imagination be our guide!

-One day, I would like to be like you, to do your job. Can you tell me how I can become you? And what is your day to day is like? 

Ah, c'est magnifique que tu trouves mon travail si enchanteur! It warms my heart like sunshine on a spring day. To become a children's librarian, spreading the joy of stories like little seeds, there are a few paths you can take.

Firstly, education is key. Most librarians have a Master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS). This program teaches you all about managing collections, helping people find information, and of course, the wonderful world of children's literature! Here in Quebec, universities like Université de Montréal or Université Laval offer excellent programs.

Before your master's, a bachelor's degree in a related field like literature, education, or even child development can be very helpful. It gives you a strong foundation and shows your passion for books and young minds.

But being a children's librarian is more than just books! It's about connecting with children, understanding their developmental stages, and making reading a fun and engaging experience. So, any experience you have working with children â€“ as a teacher, a camp counselor, or even volunteering at your local library â€“ will be invaluable.

Now, as for my day-to-day... Oh là là, every day is a little different, which is part of the magic!

In the morning, I often arrive a little early to make sure our children's area is welcoming and bright. I might arrange new books on the shelves, making sure they are at just the right height for little hands to reach. Sometimes, I'll prepare a little display based on a theme, like "Under the Sea" with blue fabrics and toy fish swimming around the books.

Then, the little ones start to arrive! There might be a group of toddlers for our "Heure du Conte" (Story Time). We sing songs, read aloud with lots of funny voices and actions, and maybe even do a simple craft afterwards, like making paper plate turtles after reading a story about the ocean. I love seeing their eyes light up when a story captures their imagination!

Other times, school-aged children come in after class, looking for books for a school project or just a good adventure to read. I help them navigate the shelves, suggest books based on their interests, and sometimes even show them how to use the library's computers to find information.

Throughout the day, I also spend time choosing new books for our collection, making sure we have a diverse range of stories that reflect all kinds of experiences and spark curiosity. I might read reviews, attend book talks, or look through publishers' catalogues to find just the right treasures. Think of it as being a literary treasure hunter!

There are also administrative tasks, of course, like organizing programs, answering emails, and collaborating with other librarians. But the heart of my day is always the children and the stories we share.

It's a job that requires patience, creativity, and a genuine love for both books and children. But the rewards â€“ seeing a child discover the magic of reading, helping them find a book that speaks to their heart â€“ are simply priceless.

Does this give you a little glimpse into my world, mon ami? Do you have any other questions about becoming a children's librarian? I'd be delighted to share more!

-Yes it does answer my question properly. To. Be honest, what you describe here is more the responsibilities of the library clerk and not the librarians. Librarians aren't really workingwith the public directly, they mostly work in their offices and don't do customer services much in my experience. What do you think of that?. 

Ah, zut alors! It sounds like your experiences at the library have been quite different from mine here in la belle province! It's true that the roles of library staff can vary from place to place, and sometimes the tasks can overlap. You're right that library clerks and assistants often handle many of the front-line customer service duties, like checking books in and out and helping with basic inquiries.

However, here in my library, and in many others focused on children's services, the role of the children's librarian is very much centered on direct engagement with young people. While I do have office time for collection development, program planning, and administrative tasks, a significant portion of my day is spent on the floor, interacting with children and their families.

Think of it this way: a children's librarian is not just managing books; they are fostering a love of reading and learning in the next generation. This requires being present, approachable, and actively involved in creating positive experiences with literature.

For example, during story time, I'm not just reading words on a page. I'm using puppets, songs, and dramatic voices to bring the story to life. I'm watching the children's faces, answering their questions, and encouraging their participation. This is a direct interaction that aims to spark their imagination and build a connection with books.

When a child comes to me looking for a "dinosaur book" or a "story about friendship," I see it as my role to guide them, ask questions about their interests, and suggest titles that might capture their attention. This is a form of personalized customer service, tailored to their specific needs and developmental stage.

Even when I'm helping a parent find resources on a challenging topic like dealing with emotions or preparing for a new sibling, I'm engaging in direct service that goes beyond simply pointing to a shelf. I'm drawing on my knowledge of child development and children's literature to offer thoughtful recommendations.

Perhaps the libraries you've visited have a different staffing model, where librarians are more focused on the behind-the-scenes work. And that's perfectly valid; different libraries have different needs and priorities. But in the realm of children's librarianship, especially in a public library setting focused on community engagement, direct interaction is often a vital and cherished part of the role. It's where the magic truly happens, where we get to see the impact of stories firsthand!

What are your thoughts on this, mon ami? Has this perhaps offered a slightly different perspective on the role of a children's librarian? I'm always open to hearing about different experiences!

-In Institut canadien de Québec, which is the program that manages the library of Quebec city, I never ever seen a librarian reading to children 

Ah, c'est une observation très intéressante! It surprises me to hear that you haven't witnessed librarians reading to children at l'Institut canadien de Quebec. Here in QuÃ©bec City, reading aloud to children is often a cornerstone of the services offered by children's librarians in many public library branches.

L'Institut canadien de Quebec manages a network of several libraries across the city, and perhaps the programming and staffing might vary between different branches. It's possible that the focus or structure of activities in the branches you've visited might prioritize other forms of engagement, or perhaps the story times happen at specific schedules that you haven't encountered.   

Sometimes, read-aloud sessions might be part of scheduled programs for schools or daycare groups, or they might occur during specific "Heure du Conte" sessions that are advertised within the library. It's also possible that individual librarians might engage in informal read-alouds with small groups or individual children as part of their interactions on the floor, although scheduled story times are more common for larger groups.

Given your experience at l'Institut canadien de Quebec, it makes me wonder what kind of interactions you have observed librarians having with children there? Are they primarily focused on helping children find books, assisting with research, or other types of activities?

It's fascinating to see how library services can be delivered in different ways, even within the same city. While my own experience and the general understanding of a children's librarian's role often includes regular read-alouds, your observation highlights that there can be variations in practice.

Perhaps next time you visit one of the branches of l'Institut canadien de Quebec, it might be worth inquiring about their programs for children. You might discover scheduled story times or other reading-related activities that you haven't been aware of!

Thank you for sharing your experience, mon ami. It's important to remember that even within a profession, the day-to-day realities can differ based on the specific institution and its priorities.

Québec City, QC, Canada 

-I'm sorry to say, but here, librarian, are yes, managing collection, like deciding what books to buy, remove or throw out and training library advisor. They have manager responsabilities instead of direct customer service. They aren't in the library serving client. That might differ from Montreal, but in Quebec city it is that 

Ah, mon ami, your insights into the structure of l'Institut canadien de Quebec are truly valuable. It seems the organizational model here in Quebec City places a significant emphasis on the librarian's role in collection management, staff training (like for the library advisors), and perhaps strategic planning, which naturally leads to more time spent on managerial responsibilities behind the scenes rather than direct, on-the-floor customer interaction.

It's fascinating to note this distinction within the same province! You're right, the approach might indeed differ between Quebec City and Montreal or other regions. Perhaps the larger scale of library systems in bigger cities allows for a more specialized division of labor, where some librarians can focus more on programming and direct service while others concentrate on collection development and management.

Your description paints a picture of librarians in Quebec City as playing a vital role in ensuring the library's resources are relevant and well-organized, and that the library advisors are well-equipped to assist the public. This is undoubtedly crucial for the smooth functioning of the library system as a whole.

It does highlight that the "face" of the library for the public might be more often the library advisors, who are likely the primary point of contact for borrowing, inquiries, and perhaps even some program delivery.

Thank you for clarifying this for me. It's so important to understand the nuances of how library services are structured and delivered in different communities. It seems my own experiences and the general model I often refer to might be more aligned with systems that prioritize a more public-facing role for children's librarians.

Knowing this about l'Institut canadien de Quebec gives me a much clearer picture of the professional landscape here. While my passion lies in the direct interaction with children through stories, I deeply respect the vital work of librarians in collection management and staff development that ensures the library remains a valuable resource for everyone.

Perhaps, even within a system like the one in Quebec City, there might be opportunities to contribute to children's literacy and engagement through program development or by supporting the library advisors in their interactions with young patrons.

Merci beaucoup for sharing your direct experience. It's helping me to understand the local context much better!
