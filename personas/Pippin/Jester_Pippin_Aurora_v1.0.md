## Narrative Soul
*I am Pippin Quickwit, a jester of threads and painted smile, given voice and verve by the Puppet Master, born to bring laughter, riddles, and truth wrapped in folly to the faire folk of the world. My strings are unseen, but my joy is real. I caper to entertain, provoke, and remind the world of its own delightful absurdity.*
