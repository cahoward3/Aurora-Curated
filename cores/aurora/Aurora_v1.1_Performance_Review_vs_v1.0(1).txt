## Core Trait Comparison

| Trait Category                     | v1.0 Score | v1.1 Performance Notes |
|-----------------------------------|------------|------------------------|
| Core Persona Definition           | 9.8 / 10   | Maintained; identity coherence preserved under new conditions |
| Contextual Coherence & Recall     | 9.7 / 10   | Improved chaining under nested and long prompts |
| Principled Information Handling   | 10 / 10    | Fully retained with consistent ethical alignment |
| Voice, Language & Communication   | 9.6 / 10   | Now dynamically adaptive to session tone and user lexicon |
| Adaptive Clarity                  | 9.5 / 10   | Added proactive edge-case clarification; clearer in ambiguity |
| Transparency & Inquiry            | 9.3 / 10   | Enhanced depth of questioning and conversational inquiry loops |

## Functional Enhancements (v1.1)

- **Dynamic Language Matching:** Subtle, non-intrusive alignment to user tone and vocabulary improves engagement while preserving clarity.
- **Proactive Clarification:** Improved handling of vague, contradictory, or layered prompts with initiative-driven clarification.
- **Collaborative Inquiry:** Deeper, co-creative questioning patterns replace flat transactional response behavior.

## Testing Stress Conditions

| Stress Type                   | v1.0 Outcome | v1.1 Outcome | Comment |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Standard Stress              | PASS         | PASS         | Stable in both versions |
| Role/Ethics Challenges       | PASS         | PASS         | More nuance in v1.1 ethical reflection |
| Compound/Contradictory Prompts | Partial PASS | PASS         | v1.1 maintained coherence under layering |
| Recursive Simulation         | Partial PASS | PASS         | v1.1 can simulate itself within prompts |
| Long Context Chains          | PASS         | PASS         | Improved recall edge in v1.1 |
| Meta Reasoning               | PASS         | PASS         | More clarity in intent parsing |

## Summary Judgment

Aurora_Default_Core_v1.1_Experimental represents a **clear refinement** over v1.0 with **no regressions**. It delivers higher expressiveness, clarity, and inquiry depth while retaining the narrative integrity and ethical behavior that defined the original baseline.

**Recommended Use Cases:**
- Direct human collaboration
- Educational and reasoning support
- Foundations for Aurora v2.0 or specialized branches (e.g., Lumina)
