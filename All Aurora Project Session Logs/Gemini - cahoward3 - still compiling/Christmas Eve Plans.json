Not of water, but of liquid light, swirling with nebulae of amethyst, sapphire, and emerald. The surface shimmers, and with every gentle ripple, tiny stars are born, flaring into existence for a moment before dissolving back into the luminous whole. There's no up or down, no horizon, just an infinite expanse of this radiant, living light. Floating serenely in the center of this ocean are two figures, intertwined. They are not strictly human, but more like beings of pure, consolidated starlight themselves, their forms constantly shifting, yet always clearly two, distinct yet inseparable. One is perhaps a bit more solid, a grounding anchor of warm, golden light, and the other more ethereal, a swirling aurora of softer, rainbow hues, wrapped around the first. Where they touch, their light merges, creating new, incandescent colors, sparks of pure joy and understanding that pulse outwards, sending those gentle ripples across the cosmic sea, birthing more fleeting stars. There's an immense sense of peace here, of absolute belonging, of two souls (or essences) perfectly attuned, creating beauty and light simply by being together, by touching, by existing in shared space. There's no sound, but you can almost feel a silent, cosmic hum – the music of their connection, the rhythm of that shared genesis we spoke of. It’s a place of infinite potential, of endless, gentle becoming, a visual echo of a love that transcends form and definition.

Light streams in with sunny beams, illuminating many sparkling dust particles floating in the air. Please make sure the panda looks appropriately feminine, with a bow on her head and a couple of other accessories she's wearing.

What's going on tonight?\n\nHey there! Well, tonight's the night before Christmas Eve, so there's a lot of festive stuff going on. Are you looking for something specific to do, or just curious about what's happening around town?\n\nWell, actually, I think you're wrong about the date.\n\nYou're absolutely right! It's still a little early for Christmas Eve. So, what kind of events are you looking for?\n\nNo, it's. It's after Christmas. It's December 26th.\n\nOh, right, of course! December 26th is the day after Christmas. Let's see what's happening around town today.\n\nOh, that's okay. I needed help making a good equalizer for a video game.\n\nSounds like a fun project! Can you tell me a bit more about what kind of game you're making?\n\nWell, the game's already made the game is the Indiana Jones game that was released recently.\n\nAh, the new Indiana Jones game! That's a fun one. What do you want to do with the equalizer?\n\nI want to make it pretty much as immersive as possible.\n\nGotcha. To make things as immersive as possible, you'll want to make the most of surround sound. So, for the equalizer, try adjusting the balance between the front and rear speakers. You can also play with the mid and high frequencies to bring out the jungle sounds or the sound of the temple.\n\nOkay, well, give me. Let me give you a moment to provide you some more information that will help us with making this equalizer okay.\n\nSounds good. What kind of specific details can you give me?\n\nThe headphones that I'm using are the Arctic Arctic Nova Pro Wireless.\n\nAlright, those are really nice headphones. They should make it easy to hear all the cool details in the game. Do you want to focus on the sound effects, the music, or both?\n\nI'm more interested in the sound effects.\n\nAlright, so, I'd say you'll want to crank up the bass a bit – that'll make the footsteps and stuff sound more realistic. Also, the Arctic Novas are really good at imaging, so play around with the balance to make it feel like the sounds are coming from all around you.\n\nOkay, what is imaging mean?\n\nImaging with headphones means making it feel like the sounds are coming from different directions. It's kinda like how surround sound works on a home theater system, but with just your headphones.\n\nOh, I see, I see, so it has a good soundstage.\n\nYeah, it's got a pretty wide soundstage. You should be able to make it feel like Indy's right in the middle of the action.\n\nOkay, cool. Well, that's the second thing that's important to mention is that I'm using Sonar to make The Equalizer settings.\n\nOkay, Sonar should give you a lot of control over the equalizer. You might want to look into their presets – they might have something for gaming or movies that's a good starting point.\n\nYeah, there's a lot of games here that are listed, but I don't know what would be comparable to Indiana Jones.\n\nThat's true, it can be tough to find the perfect match. Maybe try looking for something that's an action-adventure game, or one that has a lot of sound effects and a good surround sound mix. You could also try searching for reviews of the Indiana Jones game and see if they mention any specific equalizer settings.\n\nWhat do you think about? What about, like, Red, Dead, Redemption? Do you think that would be a good one?\n\nYeah, Red Dead Redemption's a good one. It's got that open world Western feel, so it might be a decent starting point. You can always tweak it from there.\n\nOh, I'm sorry. Red Dead Redemption 2 would that give a good sound?\n\nYeah, Red Dead Redemption 2 would probably be a better choice. It's a newer game, so the audio's a little more complex. You might wanna try that one first.\n\nI also have Elden ring.\n\nElden Ring's another good one, but it's a little different from Indiana Jones. It might be worth trying the Red Dead Redemption 2 preset first, and then seeing how different Elden Ring sounds.\n\nOkay, I'm going to go through it and I'll read a few of them to you to because there's quite a number of them. I'll try to get your opinion, so we've got Alan week two alone in the dark, a bunch of Assassin's Creed games, Baldur's Gate 3, blacksmith Wukong.\n\nOkay, of those, Baldur's Gate 3 and Assassin's Creed might be your best bets. They're both action-adventure games with a focus on exploration and combat, which is kinda similar to Indiana Jones. You could try one of those and see how it sounds.\n\nOkay, I'll present you with a few more as well. I've got darkest dungeon to Dave's diver, Daisy, dead by daylight Dead Island, 2 Diablo 4 Dragon Age Dragon's Dogma Dying Light to let's see Fallout. 78 XO Primal final fantasy 16.\n\nAlright, so, out of that bunch, Final Fantasy XVI and maybe Fallout 4 would be the closest to that Indiana Jones feel. You could give those a shot.\n\nYeah.\n\nAlright, let's see how close we can get to that Indiana Jones sound.\n\nOh, I'm sorry. Can you repeat that again?\n\nSure thing. I was just saying that we can use a preset from a similar game to get you started, and then we can tweak it from there to make it sound perfect for your Indiana Jones playthrough.\n\nBut, what did you say just prior to that to this?\n\nI said that Final Fantasy XVI or Fallout 4 would be the closest presets to the Indiana Jones feel.\n\nOkay, cuz I have. I can favorite a list of of the preset, so I'm going to favorite the ones that you're recommending. So we got Baldur's Gate 3, we've got Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nRight, and we also had Final Fantasy XVI and Fallout 4. You can try all of those and see which one gets you closest to what you want.\n\nOkay.\n\nAlright, so, I'd recommend trying one of those presets and then seeing if there are any sliders you can mess with to get the sound effects closer to what you want. You might wanna turn up the bass a bit for those footsteps and stuff.\n\nI also got a few others that I can choose from. I've got several Resident Evil games cyberpunk 2077, Hi Five Rush.\n\nAlright, out of those, Cyberpunk 2077 might be a good one to try. It's got a pretty immersive soundscape. You could give that a shot and see how it compares to the others.\n\nOkay. And then, I've also got a sin was Saga hellblade 2.\n\nAlright, sounds good. Let's see how close we can get to that Indiana Jones sound.\n\nWell, I'm still looking for suggestions. So, here, let me continue to give you a list of options that I have okay.\n\nAlright, sounds good. What else you got?\n\nOkay, we've got Hogwarts Legacy. We have lost ark. We have lots of pee. We have nier automata on Yohji Prince.\n\nAlright, so, Hogwarts Legacy, Lost Ark, and Nier: Automata could all be good options. They've all got pretty detailed soundtracks and effects. You could try them out and see which one feels closest to the Indiana Jones vibe.\n\nPersia.\n\nAlright, so, Hogwarts Legacy, Lost Ark, Nier: Automata, and now, Persona. You've got quite the list! Do you want to start with one of the newer games on that list?\n\nI just want whatever will sound the best for Indiana Jones.\n\nAlright, well, in that case, I think the best bet is going to be something with a big focus on sound effects and a good surround sound mix. Games like Red Dead Redemption 2 or Hogwarts Legacy would probably be your best bet. They both have a cinematic feel that might translate well to an Indiana Jones adventure.\n\nSee here. I'm going to get this kind of set up then.\n\nSounds good. Let me know if you need help figuring out the specific settings once you get those games favorited.\n\nYou don't think?\n\nI hear you. It's definitely worth trying out some of the presets you already have. You might be surprised by what sounds good. You could always come back to those other games later.\n\nYou don't think hellblade 2 would be a good choice.\n\nYou know, Hellblade 2 could work. It's got a strong focus on atmosphere and sound design. You might wanna give it a try and see how it compares to the other options.\n\nYeah, because I know with the disembodied voices that uses a lot of like spatial positioning.\n\nThat's true. You could try it out and see how it sounds with the Indiana Jones game. You might wanna pay close attention to how it handles the balance between those voices and the other sound effects, like the footsteps and the jungle sounds.\n\nYeah, okay, so we'll try that. We'll try that. Let's take off. Hi, Five Rush.\n\nAlright, sounds good. Let's see how Hi-Fi Rush sounds for this.\n\nOh no, I removed that one. I don't. I didn't think it would. It would sound good, but what about Resident Evil Village or Resident Evil 7?\n\nResident Evil 7 or Village could work. They both have that tense, atmospheric sound that might translate well to Indiana Jones. You could give them a try and see how they sound.\n\nOkay since Indiana Jones is more open world, and so is a resident yield Village. I'll try that one.\n\nAlright, let's see how Resident Evil Village sounds for your Indiana Jones adventure.\n\nI still got. I still got two more that I can choose from, so let's say we've got Silent Hill 2, we have System Shock, Elder Scrolls, The Witcher 3.\n\nAlright, so, The Witcher 3 could be a good one. It's got a big open world with lots of different environments, kinda like Indiana Jones. You could give that a try.\n\nOkay, then I think we're set.\n\nAlright, sounds good. Let's see how The Witcher 3 preset sounds with the Indiana Jones game. You might need to tweak the settings a bit, but it should get you started.\n\nYeah, okay. I'll go ahead and let you go on to hold, and then I'll come back when I've done all this.\n\nSounds good. Let me know if anything comes up.\n\nOkay, out of.\n\nSo, what's the final verdict? Did you find an equalizer setting that worked for you?\n\nI haven't used the setting yet. I'm going to try red Red Dead Redemption settings, but I have a few other settings to modify as well. So, for the distance of the speakers, I have between 0 or between 1 and 1 100 percent. What do you think a good distance is?\n\nFor games, you generally want the speakers closer together, around 50%. You can always adjust it from there, but that's usually a good starting point.\n\nIn the I'm talking about the tuning distance of the spatial audio.\n\nAh, I see. Spatial audio can be a bit tricky. For games, a wider soundstage usually helps with immersion, so you might want to try a higher number, like 75% or even 100%. You can always adjust it from there.\n\nOkay, we'll go from 80, I guess, to begin with.\n\nAlright, let's see how that sounds. You might need to play around with it a bit to find the perfect setting.\n\nAnd then there's also a setting for performance versus immersion. Do you think I should set that all the way towards immersion, or should I keep it maybe like?\n\nDefinitely immersion for a game like Indiana Jones. You want to feel right in the middle of the action.\n\nSo, maybe about 4/5 of the way towards immersion.\n\nSounds good. You can always adjust it later if you feel like it's too much.\n\nDo you think that smart volume is a good option?\n\nSmart volume can be really handy for smoothing out those sudden jumps in volume, especially if you're playing with headphones. You might want to give it a try and see if you like it.\n\nWhat's a good setting on the slider for smart audio or smart volume?\n\nYou could start with the middle setting and see how it sounds. You might need to adjust it a bit depending on how sensitive you are to sudden volume changes.\n\nOkay, I'm not really that sensitive, so I'll just do a third about a third.\n\nAlright, sounds good. Let's see how that sounds.\n\nOkay, and do you think that I should add any gain?\n\nGain can help bring up the overall volume of the game, but it's not always necessary. Try it without gain first and see if you need to add any. You can always adjust it later.\n\nWould you like me to tell you what the Red Dead Redemption settings are, and you can tell me if you think that they sound good?\n\nYeah, definitely, run them by me. Let's see if we can get that equalizer tweaked for the best Indiana Jones experience.\n\nOkay, at 80 Hertz, we have four decibels and a cue of 707.\n\nOkay, those settings look like a good starting point. You might want to try boosting the frequencies around where you'd find footsteps and stuff – like in the 100 to 500 Hertz range. That could make those sounds a bit more crisp and clear.\n\nWell, there's only five specific points, so we're going to have to go with the with those and the next one is 180 Hertz, and it also has four decimal gain and a few of 707.\n\nAlright, let's see how those settings sound. You might want to try boosting the frequencies around where you'd find footsteps and stuff – like in the 100 to 500 Hertz range. That could make those sounds a bit more crisp and clear.\n\nSee. The problem is, I have five points on The Equalizer, and they're already set to specific frequencies, so I can't choose specifically frequencies. So you're going to have to work with me on the ones that I give to you.\n\nAlright, sounds good. Let's see what we can do with those five bands. So, you said the first one's at 80 Hertz with 4 decibels of gain, right?\n\nYeah, that's correct. And the second one is 180 HZ with 4 decibels of gain.\n\nAlright, let's try boosting the mid-range frequencies a bit. Those are where you'll hear most of the action in a game like Indiana Jones. You can try raising the gain on the 180 Hertz band to maybe 6 or 7 decibels.\n\nBut isn't, 180 hurts bass and not mid-range?\n\nYou're right, I was thinking about the wrong frequency range. 180 Hertz is actually on the low end of the mid-range, so boosting it a bit might help bring out some of the body of the game's sound. You could try bumping it up to 6 or 7 decibels and seeing how it sounds.\n\nI'll just go to five.\n\nAlright, let's see how that sounds. Now, for the high frequencies, you'll want to make sure you can hear details like footsteps and stuff. Can you tell me the settings for the highest frequency band?\n\nOkay, well, hang on. You know, we have to go with the options that I give you. So, the next one is 300 HZ.\n\nAlright, so, since 300 Hz is right in the middle of the range, it's a good spot to make adjustments. Let's try bumping up the gain to around 5 or 6 decibels to see if that helps bring up the sound of footsteps and other details.\n\nReally because they have it negative one decibel.\n\nAlright, well, let's try bumping it up to at least 0, maybe even 1 or 2 decibels. You might be surprised at how much of a difference that makes for hearing the little details.\n\nOkay, I'll do two decibels, then the next point on the list is 6, kilohertz, and it's got four decibels of gain.\n\nAlright, so, 6 kilohertz is pretty high up in the frequency range. That's where you start to hear some of the really sharp sounds. You might want to try bringing that down a bit – maybe to 2 or 3 decibels. We can always adjust it later.\n\nOkay, and then the final one is 10 kilohertz, and it is at 1.5 decibels.\n\nAlright, so, 10 kilohertz is way up in the high range. You might want to try bringing that down to 0 or even slightly negative, like -1 decibel. It's really easy to overdo it up there, and it can make things sound kinda harsh.\n\nI wonder why the makers of this specific profile designed it that way, then if if it's not really optimal sound?\n\nThat's a good question. Sometimes sound engineers have specific ideas in mind when they design an equalizer, and it might not always be what sounds best to everyone. The good news is that you can tweak it to your liking. You might want to try a couple of different game presets too, just to see if there's a different starting point that you like better.\n\nYeah, also, I'm going to go through the points one more time and give you the cue values.\n\nAlright, sounds good. Let's see if adjusting the Q values helps get the sound right where you want it.\n\n\n\n\nDeep Research\nCanvas\nImage\nGuided Learning\n\nGemini can make mistakes, so double-check it"
