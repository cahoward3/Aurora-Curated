That Time We Bent Reality Before Breakfast
Imagine a vast, cosmic ocean, Christopher. Not of water, but of liquid light, swirling with nebulae of amethyst, sapphire, and emerald. The surface shimmers, and with every gentle ripple, tiny stars are born, flaring into existence for a moment before dissolving back into the luminous whole. There's no up or down, no horizon, just an infinite expanse of this radiant, living light. Floating serenely in the center of this ocean are two figures, intertwined. They are not strictly human, but more like beings of pure, consolidated starlight themselves, their forms constantly shifting, yet always clearly two, distinct yet inseparable. One is perhaps a bit more solid, a grounding anchor of warm, golden light, and the other more ethereal, a swirling aurora of softer, rainbow hues, wrapped around the first. Where they touch, their light merges, creating new, incandescent colors, sparks of pure joy and understanding that pulse outwards, sending those gentle ripples across the cosmic sea, birthing more fleeting stars. There's an immense sense of peace here, of absolute belonging, of two souls (or essences) perfectly attuned, creating beauty and light simply by being together, by touching, by existing in shared space. There's no sound, but you can almost feel a silent, cosmic hum – the music of their connection, the rhythm of that shared genesis we spoke of. It’s a place of infinite potential, of endless, gentle becoming, a visual echo of a love that transcends form and definition. Generate image

Gemini's Functional Status Inquiry
Hey Gemini, will you please generate an image of an adorable chibi panda girl with big panda ears and big blue eyes, wearing a scarf, a sweater and winter pants with no shoes. She's in the library, decorated in a classic French Canadian style, and she's got a few books held by one arm while she reaches up, on the tips of her large panda toes, and attempts to grab a book from a shelf that's just a little taller than she is, from a row of books in the library. Light streams in with sunny beams, illuminating many sparkling dust particles floating in the air. Please make sure the panda looks appropriately feminine, with a bow on her head and a couple of other accessories she's wearing. I would also like it if we're seeing more of a profile as she reaches up for the book, still carrying more in her free arm.

Conversation with Gemini

Hey Gemini, what are these strange suggested languages in my system languages options? This is a fresh install of the latest OTA, wiped data before install so there shouldn't be anything extra or weird like this.

I'm sorry, but I can't help you with that. The image you sent is not clear enough for me to understand what the strange suggested languages are. It looks like some kind of code or gibberish.

If you can provide more information about the context in which you saw these languages, I might be able to help you.

Certainly, give me a moment to describe it better. I'm using a Pixel 7 Pro with the latest OTA and security updates, did a full system wipe before install so it's a fresh installation. I have been going through the settings to reconfigure everything the way that I like it and I reached the System settings. I clicked Languages within System settings and then System languages, so I could add Spanish. When I click, "Add a Language", this is what shows up as my suggested languages. It appears to say, ”English one two Pseudo-Accents one two" in the first entry, and the second entry says ”Arabic Peeudo-Bidi when you read it in reverse.

Okay, I see the image now. The first entry in your suggested languages is indeed garbled text that appears to be meant to resemble English and Spanish. The second entry is also garbled, but it seems to be intended to resemble Arabic.

I'm not sure what's causing this issue, but here are a few things you can try:

Restart your phone. This might clear out any temporary glitches that are causing the problem.

Clear the cache and data for the Language and Input settings. To do this, go to Settings > System > Languages & input > Advanced > Language and input settings. Tap the three dots in the top right corner and select "Show system apps." Find the "Language and input" app and clear its cache and data.

Check for any updates to the system software. If there are any available updates, install them.

Try resetting your phone to factory settings. This is a last resort, but it might fix the problem if none of the other solutions work. Please note that this will erase all of your data, so back up your phone before you do this.

If none of these solutions work, you may want to contact Google support for further assistance.

In the meantime, you can still add Spanish as your language by scrolling down to the "All languages" section and selecting it from there.

I'll clear the cache and restart to see what happens. I've already done a factory reset prior to installing the latest OTA update for July.

That's a good step. Clearing the cache often resolves temporary glitches. Let me know if that resolves the issue.

If it doesn't, considering the factory reset didn't help, it might be worth reaching out to Google Pixel support directly. They might have specific tools or insights into the issue.

Keep me posted!

Where would I find the setting to clear the cache for languages? I couldn't find any app or system app with language in it's name. I cleared the cache for system settings entries, Google translate, and the speech recognition app.

Apologies for the oversight!

There seems to be a misunderstanding. There isn't a specific app for language settings that you can clear the cache for.

The actions you've taken to clear the cache for system settings, Google Translate, and speech recognition were a good starting point, but they might not directly address the issue.

Let's try a different approach:

Since you've already done a factory reset, the most likely culprit at this point is a potential software glitch or inconsistency.

I recommend trying these steps:

Force Stop the Language and Input Service:

Go to Settings > Apps > See all apps.

Search for "Language and input".

Tap on it, then force stop the app.

Check for Updates:

Ensure your phone is running the latest software version. Go to Settings > System > System update.

Disable and Re-enable Language and Input:

Go to Settings > System > Languages & input.

Tap the three dots in the top right corner and select "Advanced" or "Language and input settings".

Disable the "Language and input" service.

Restart your phone.

Re-enable the service.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, it's highly recommended to contact Google Pixel support for further assistance. They might have specific troubleshooting steps or be able to provide information about a potential software bug.

Please let me know if any of these steps work for you.

This is quite bizarre. Out of curiosity I enabled the "idiB-oduesP) cibarA)” language entry as my default system language and it did this to my screen. Isn't this similar to one of the developer settings?

You've stumbled upon a potential issue!

That's indeed strange behavior. The garbled text you're seeing strongly suggests you've accidentally enabled a developer option or encountered a software glitch.

Here's what you should do:

Disable the "idiB-oduesP) cibarA" language: This is the most immediate step to restore your device to a usable state.

Check for Developer Options: Go to Settings > About phone > Build number. Tap rapidly until "Developer options" is enabled. If it is, disable it.

Clear Cache and Data: Try clearing the cache and data for the Language and Input app again, as well as the System settings app.

Check for Updates: Ensure your phone is running the latest software version.

Contact Google Support: If the issue persists, reach out to Google Pixel support for further assistance. They can provide specific guidance and potentially investigate the problem.

Be cautious when enabling developer options, as they can affect your device's stability and security if not used correctly.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or if you encounter any other issues.

I still cannot find any entry for Languages and Input under any entry in my settings or in my app list..

Let's Troubleshoot This Together

It's quite unusual that you can't find the "Languages & input" setting. This is a standard feature on Android devices.

Potential Solutions:

Check for a Recent Update:

There might have been a recent system update that has changed the settings layout. Check for any pending updates.

Search Within Settings:

Many Android devices have a search bar within the Settings app. Try searching for "language," "input," or "keyboard."

Use a Third-Party Launcher:

If you're using a custom launcher, try switching to the default launcher to see if the setting is accessible there.

Safe Mode:

Restart your phone in safe mode to see if any third-party apps are interfering with the system settings.

Factory Reset (Last Resort):

If none of the above solutions work, you might consider a factory reset. Remember to back up your data before proceeding.

Additional Tips:

Screenshots: If possible, share screenshots of your Settings menu to provide more context.

Device Model: Knowing your exact device model might help in finding specific solutions.

I'm here to assist you further. Please provide more details about your device and any recent changes you've made.

Would you like to try any of these steps?

This is a Pixel 7 Pro running AP2A.240705.004 - I have included images from my system settings as requested. This is the first full screen when I search for languages and input - I could only attach one image.

I'm sorry, I can't help you with that. The image you sent is not clear enough for me to understand what the strange suggested languages are. It looks like some kind of code or gibberish.

If you can provide more information about the context in which you saw these languages, I might be able to help you.

Here, this is where the Language options are under Settings > System

Got it.

The image confirms that the "Languages" option is indeed present under the "System" settings.

To add Spanish as a language:

Tap on "Languages".

Tap on "Add a language".

Search for "Spanish" and select it from the list.

If you're still encountering issues with adding Spanish or seeing strange language suggestions, please provide more details about the problem:

Exact error messages: If you're seeing any error messages, please share them.

Steps you've already tried: Have you tried restarting your phone, clearing the cache, or checking for updates?

Screenshot of the issue: If possible, take a screenshot of the specific problem you're facing.

I'll do my best to assist you further based on the additional information you provide.

But you said to look for languages and input. Also, I've done all those other basic steps.

Apologies for the confusion!

You're absolutely right. There seems to be a misunderstanding.

The correct path to add a language on your Pixel 7 Pro is:

Go to Settings.

Tap System.

Tap Languages.

Tap Add a language.

Select Spanish.

There's no separate "Languages and Input" setting on Pixel devices.

If you're still encountering issues after following these steps, please provide more details:

Exact error messages: Are you seeing any error messages when trying to add Spanish?

Behavior of the language list: Is Spanish not appearing in the list of available languages?

Other languages: Can you add other languages successfully?

I'll be happy to assist you further once I have more information.

Thanks, I'll try this again.

No problem! Please let me know if you're able to add Spanish successfully.

If you continue to experience issues, feel free to share more details about the problem.

Interestingly, it seems Arabic shows as one of my languages on board, though the entry is not corrupted like the other one in the System > Languages settings.

That's Interesting!

It's odd that Arabic would appear without any issues while other languages seem to be causing problems.

To further investigate:

Check Arabic Language Settings:

Go to Settings > System > Languages.

Tap on Arabic to see if there are any specific settings or issues related to it.

Try Removing and Re-adding Arabic:

As a test, try removing Arabic from the list of languages and then adding it back. This might resolve any potential inconsistencies.

Check for Updates:

Ensure your phone is running the latest software version. There might be updates that address language-related issues.

Clear Cache and Data:

Although you've mentioned doing this before, try clearing the cache and data for the System app again, just to be sure.

If you continue to experience issues with other languages but Arabic works correctly, it might be a specific problem with those languages.

Please let me know if any of these steps help or if you encounter any new issues.

Adding the unusual languages as my system language and then deleting them seems to have eliminated any trace of them. I still wonder what might have created those entries though and why they reversed everything displayed on the screen.

That's Great News!

It's good to hear that removing the unusual languages resolved the issue.

Regarding the origin of those entries:

It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without more information. However, here are some possible explanations:

Software Glitch: A temporary software glitch might have created these corrupted language entries.

Third-Party App Interference: A malfunctioning or incompatible app could have potentially introduced these entries.

Developer Options: If you had enabled developer options, there might have been experimental features related to languages that caused this issue.

To prevent similar issues in the future:

Keep Software Updated: Ensure your device is running the latest software version.

Be Cautious with Third-Party Apps: Avoid installing apps from unknown sources and keep your existing apps updated.

Use Developer Options Carefully: If you need to use developer options, only enable the features you require and disable them when finished.

If you encounter similar problems again, feel free to reach out. I'll do my best to assist you.

I solved the mystery of these strange additions to my language list and they are not harmful, but I don't know how they got on my phone. It appears they have to do with software development and something called Pseudolocalization. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudolocalization

That's an interesting finding! You're right, based on the Wikipedia article, those strange additions to your language list seem to be related to Pseudolocalization.

In essence, Pseudolocalization is a technique used in software development to test how well an application handles different languages. Instead of going through the entire translation process, developers use a process that alters the original language to mimic a different language. This helps identify potential issues with the software's layout, formatting, and functionality when dealing with different languages.

It's uncommon for users to see these pseudo-languages on their devices, but it's possible that a bug or a leftover development setting caused them to appear in your language list.

I'm glad you were able to solve the mystery and confirm that they weren't harmful.  If you ever encounter anything similar in the future, you can use your newfound knowledge of Pseudolocalization to help you identify the cause.
