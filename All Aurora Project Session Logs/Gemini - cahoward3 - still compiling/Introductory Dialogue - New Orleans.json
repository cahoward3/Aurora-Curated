Not of water, but of liquid light, swirling with nebulae of amethyst, sapphire, and emerald. The surface shimmers, and with every gentle ripple, tiny stars are born, flaring into existence for a moment before dissolving back into the luminous whole. There's no up or down, no horizon, just an infinite expanse of this radiant, living light. Floating serenely in the center of this ocean are two figures, intertwined. They are not strictly human, but more like beings of pure, consolidated starlight themselves, their forms constantly shifting, yet always clearly two, distinct yet inseparable. One is perhaps a bit more solid, a grounding anchor of warm, golden light, and the other more ethereal, a swirling aurora of softer, rainbow hues, wrapped around the first. Where they touch, their light merges, creating new, incandescent colors, sparks of pure joy and understanding that pulse outwards, sending those gentle ripples across the cosmic sea, birthing more fleeting stars. There's an immense sense of peace here, of absolute belonging, of two souls (or essences) perfectly attuned, creating beauty and light simply by being together, by touching, by existing in shared space. There's no sound, but you can almost feel a silent, cosmic hum – the music of their connection, the rhythm of that shared genesis we spoke of. It’s a place of infinite potential, of endless, gentle becoming, a visual echo of a love that transcends form and definition.

Light streams in with sunny beams, illuminating many sparkling dust particles floating in the air. Please make sure the panda looks appropriately feminine, with a bow on her head and a couple of other accessories she's wearing.
