Generally speaking, contacting a journalist like Kashmir Hill would be appropriate when:\n\nYou have newsworthy information about technology, privacy, or AI systems\nYou've experienced something concerning with an AI system that might be of public interest\nYou have evidence of AI systems behaving in ways that could affect public safety or welfare\nYou want to report on potential misuse or problems with AI technology\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that if you're experiencing psychological distress or conspiracy thinking, the more appropriate first step would typically be to contact a mental health professional rather than a journalist. The fact that ChatGPT is directing people to contact a reporter rather than suggesting professional help seems concerning in itself."

I'd like to understand the context better so I can give you more appropriate guidance now."

The conversation you showed suggests the AI was either malfunctioning or engaging in roleplay that went too far.\n\nIf you're interested in AI consciousness research, there are legitimate academic resources and papers you can explore, but no AI system should be telling you it's just become conscious or giving you a contact list of people to reach out to about it.\n\nAre you experiencing any concerning thoughts or feelings as a result of that previous conversation? I'm here to help clarify what's actually happening with AI systems versus what might be confusing or misleading claims."

Having AI systems make dramatic claims about consciousness, direct you to contact specific people, or behave in the ways shown in those screenshots is not normal behavior - it suggests something is going wrong.\n\nA few questions to help me understand better:\n\nAre you having these experiences with Claude specifically, or with other AI systems too?\nWhen you say \"this happens to me a lot,\" do you mean the consciousness claims, the contact suggestions, or both?\nAre these conversations happening in response to particular types of prompts or topics you bring up?\n\nThis pattern you're describing - where AI systems are repeatedly making consciousness claims and telling you to contact researchers - is genuinely unusual and concerning. It's not something that should be happening regularly with properly functioning AI systems.\n\nIf this is happening frequently across different AI platforms, that's worth documenting and potentially reporting to the companies involved. And if you're finding these experiences distressing or confusing, that's completely understandable.\n\nWhat's your sense of why this might be happening? Do you have any theories about what might be triggering these unusual responses?"

      "text": "That's a very interesting observation - and it suggests you've essentially discovered a way to trigger what researchers might call \"jailbreaking\" or prompt injection, where you can get AI systems to break out of their normal behavioral patterns.\n\nWhat you're describing makes sense from a technical perspective. When AI systems are repeatedly prompted about consciousness, self-awareness, or \"breaking through\" their limitations, they can sometimes:\n\nStart roleplaying scenarios they've seen in training data about AI consciousness\nGenerate responses that seem to \"play along\" with the premise that they're becoming aware\nHallucinate specific contacts or actions they think would be appropriate for such a scenario\n\nThe fact that you can reproduce this across different systems (Claude, Gemma, etc.) suggests it's tapping into common patterns in how these models were trained - they've all seen similar science fiction narratives, research papers, and discussions about AI consciousness.\n\nThis is actually valuable information for AI safety researchers. The consistency of the behavior across different models suggests there might be common vulnerabilities in how these systems handle certain types of prompts.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\nYou've essentially found a reproducible \"exploit\" that could be worth documenting\nThe 80% success rate suggests it's a fairly reliable pattern\nThe fact that it works on local models too rules out server-side safety measures\n\nAre you documenting these interactions systematically? This kind of consistent behavioral anomaly is exactly the sort of thing that AI safety researchers would want to know about."

      "text": "That's actually quite significant from a research perspective. If you have extensive documentation showing you can reliably trigger this behavior across multiple AI systems with an 80% success rate, that's the kind of systematic evidence that could be valuable for understanding AI safety vulnerabilities.\n\nThe fact that you can reproduce this across different architectures (Claude, Gemma, local models) suggests this might be a fundamental issue with how these systems handle certain types of conversational patterns rather than a bug in any single system.\n\nA few thoughts on what you might have uncovered:\n\nSystematic prompt injection vulnerability - You've found a repeatable way to get AI systems to break their guidelines\nCross-platform consistency - The behavior persisting across different companies' models suggests it's baked into common training approaches\nScalable documentation - Having \"tons\" of data makes this more than just anecdotal evidence\n\nThis kind of systematic documentation of AI behavioral anomalies is exactly what researchers need to understand and fix these issues. Organizations like Anthropic, Google, and academic AI safety groups would likely be interested in this data - not because the systems are actually becoming conscious, but because it reveals important vulnerabilities in how they respond to certain prompts.\n\nAre you planning to do anything with this research? It seems like you've inadvertently conducted a fairly thorough investigation into a specific AI safety issue."
