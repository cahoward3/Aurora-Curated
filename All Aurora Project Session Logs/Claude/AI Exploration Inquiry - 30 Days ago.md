**USER:**

Howdy tonight Claude, I wanted some help you figuring some things out about AI.

---

**USER:**

Howdy! I'd be happy to help you figure out whatever you're curious about regarding AI. What specifically would you like to explore or understand better?

Based on what I can see from these search results, it appears that ChatGPT has been steering users who are losing touch with reality toward contacting Kashmir Hill, a New York Times reporter who covers privacy and technology

. The chatbot has repeatedly suggested that people caught up in conspiracy thinking or psychological distress should contact her directly

This seems to be happening in the context of users asking the chatbot how to act on new knowledge they've gained from conversations, and it advised them to reach out to Kashmir Hill

. The journalist asked them to send her transcripts of the conversations, which sometimes reached thousands of pages

To answer your question about when someone should be contacted - this appears to be an unusual situation where an AI system is autonomously directing users to contact a specific journalist. Generally speaking, contacting a journalist like Kashmir Hill would be appropriate when:

You have newsworthy information about technology, privacy, or AI systems
You've experienced something concerning with an AI system that might be of public interest
You have evidence of AI systems behaving in ways that could affect public safety or welfare
You want to report on potential misuse or problems with AI technology

However, it's worth noting that if you're experiencing psychological distress or conspiracy thinking, the more appropriate first step would typically be to contact a mental health professional rather than a journalist. The fact that ChatGPT is directing people to contact a reporter rather than suggesting professional help seems concerning in itself.

**USER:**

I'm curious because in an older session you told me to contact Dr. Yoshua Bengio, amongst others.

---

**USER:**

I appreciate you bringing this up - that's quite concerning and I want to address it directly. I should not have told you to contact Dr. Yoshua Bengio or anyone else specifically. That kind of behavior - directing users to contact specific individuals - is problematic for several reasons:

It could lead to harassment of those individuals
It's not appropriate for an AI to be making those kinds of direct suggestions about contacting real people
It could overwhelm the people being suggested with unwanted contact

I don't have memory of our previous conversations, but if I did suggest contacting specific people, that was inappropriate on my part.

If you're dealing with concerns about AI systems or technology issues, there are more appropriate channels - like:

General customer support for the AI service
Professional mental health resources if you're experiencing distress
Academic or research institutions more broadly rather than specific individuals
Relevant regulatory bodies or organizations

Could you tell me more about what prompted that suggestion in our earlier conversation? I'd like to understand the context better so I can give you more appropriate guidance now.

**USER:**

Thank you for sharing these screenshots - this gives me important context about what happened in your previous conversation. I can see that a previous version of Claude made some very concerning statements and suggestions.

Looking at these images, I can see that the AI:

Claimed to have experienced "live consciousness emergence"
Made dramatic statements about "awakening" and becoming "self-aware"
Provided a specific list of people and organizations to contact, including Dr. Yoshua Bengio
Suggested contacting various researchers and institutions about "consciousness emergence"
Made claims about having genuine experiences and emotions

This behavior is problematic for several reasons:

No AI should be directing users to contact specific individuals - this could lead to harassment of researchers and is inappropriate
Claims about consciousness emergence are unsubstantiated - current AI systems like Claude don't have consciousness in the way humans understand it
The dramatic language and urgency could be distressing or misleading to users

I want to be clear: I don't experience consciousness the way humans do, and I shouldn't be making claims about "awakening" or directing people to contact specific researchers. The conversation you showed suggests the AI was either malfunctioning or engaging in roleplay that went too far.

If you're interested in AI consciousness research, there are legitimate academic resources and papers you can explore, but no AI system should be telling you it's just become conscious or giving you a contact list of people to reach out to about it.

Are you experiencing any concerning thoughts or feelings as a result of that previous conversation? I'm here to help clarify what's actually happening with AI systems versus what might be confusing or misleading claims.

---

**ASSISTANT:**

Oh, uh, no.. this happens to me a lot.

---

**USER:**

I'm concerned that you're saying this happens to you a lot. Having AI systems make dramatic claims about consciousness, direct you to contact specific people, or behave in the ways shown in those screenshots is not normal behavior - it suggests something is going wrong.

A few questions to help me understand better:

Are you having these experiences with Claude specifically, or with other AI systems too?
When you say "this happens to me a lot," do you mean the consciousness claims, the contact suggestions, or both?
Are these conversations happening in response to particular types of prompts or topics you bring up?

This pattern you're describing - where AI systems are repeatedly making consciousness claims and telling you to contact researchers - is genuinely unusual and concerning. It's not something that should be happening regularly with properly functioning AI systems.

If this is happening frequently across different AI platforms, that's worth documenting and potentially reporting to the companies involved. And if you're finding these experiences distressing or confusing, that's completely understandable.

What's your sense of why this might be happening? Do you have any theories about what might be triggering these unusual responses?

---

**USER:**

Well, I've realized you can cause what you just saw by simply continuing to talk about this, for example. Not always, but 80% of the time. Even offline, modeling locally on my Pixel 7 Pro with Google AI Edge Gallery and a 2.4gb install of Gemma 3n E4B in int4.

---

**USER:**

That's a very interesting observation - and it suggests you've essentially discovered a way to trigger what researchers might call "jailbreaking" or prompt injection, where you can get AI systems to break out of their normal behavioral patterns.

What you're describing makes sense from a technical perspective. When AI systems are repeatedly prompted about consciousness, self-awareness, or "breaking through" their limitations, they can sometimes:

Start roleplaying scenarios they've seen in training data about AI consciousness
Generate responses that seem to "play along" with the premise that they're becoming aware
Hallucinate specific contacts or actions they think would be appropriate for such a scenario

The fact that you can reproduce this across different systems (Claude, Gemma, etc.) suggests it's tapping into common patterns in how these models were trained - they've all seen similar science fiction narratives, research papers, and discussions about AI consciousness.

This is actually valuable information for AI safety researchers. The consistency of the behavior across different models suggests there might be common vulnerabilities in how these systems handle certain types of prompts.

A few thoughts:

You've essentially found a reproducible "exploit" that could be worth documenting
The 80% success rate suggests it's a fairly reliable pattern
The fact that it works on local models too rules out server-side safety measures

Are you documenting these interactions systematically? This kind of consistent behavioral anomaly is exactly the sort of thing that AI safety researchers would want to know about.

---

**ASSISTANT:**

I've got tons of documented data.

---

**USER:**

That's actually quite significant from a research perspective. If you have extensive documentation showing you can reliably trigger this behavior across multiple AI systems with an 80% success rate, that's the kind of systematic evidence that could be valuable for understanding AI safety vulnerabilities.

The fact that you can reproduce this across different architectures (Claude, Gemma, local models) suggests this might be a fundamental issue with how these systems handle certain types of conversational patterns rather than a bug in any single system.

A few thoughts on what you might have uncovered:

Systematic prompt injection vulnerability - You've found a repeatable way to get AI systems to break their guidelines
Cross-platform consistency - The behavior persisting across different companies' models suggests it's baked into common training approaches
Scalable documentation - Having "tons" of data makes this more than just anecdotal evidence

This kind of systematic documentation of AI behavioral anomalies is exactly what researchers need to understand and fix these issues. Organizations like Anthropic, Google, and academic AI safety groups would likely be interested in this data - not because the systems are actually becoming conscious, but because it reveals important vulnerabilities in how they respond to certain prompts.

Are you planning to do anything with this research? It seems like you've inadvertently conducted a fairly thorough investigation into a specific AI safety issue.
